//The tf package provides an implementation of a tf::TransformBroadcaster to help make the task of publishing transforms easier. 
//To use the TransformBroadcaster, we need to include the tf/transform_broadcaster.h header file.

  //Here, we create a TransformBroadcaster object that we'll use later to send the base_link â†’ base_laser transform over the wire.

      tf::StampedTransform(
        tf::Transform(tf::Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 1), tf::Vector3(0.1, 0.0, -0.165)), //Measured on real turtlebot

    /*This is where the real work is done. Sending a transform with a TransformBroadcaster requires five arguments.
    First, we pass in the rotation transform, which is specified by a btQuaternion for any rotation that needs to occur between the two coordinate frames.
    In this case, we want to apply no rotation, so we send in a btQuaternion constructed from pitch, roll, and yaw values equal to zero. 
    Second, a btVector3 for any translation that we'd like to apply.
    We do, however, want to apply a translation, so we create a btVector3 corresponding to the laser's x offset of 10cm and z offset of 20cm from the robot base. 
    Third, we need to give the transform being published a timestamp, we'll just stamp it with ros::Time::now(). 
    Fourth, we need to pass the name of the parent node of the link we're creating, in this case "base_link.
    "Fifth, we need to pass the name of the child node of the link we're creating, in this case "base_laser." */
